Some of the 'new atheists', including Richard Dawkins and others of his ilk, subscribe to a very narrow and specific definition of the term 'religiosity'. According to several of Dawkins' quips on Twitter and in his articles and books, he sees religion as a kind of mental delusion that causes people to believe all kinds of incredible things. It then goes without saying that anyone who believes such things cannot be relied on to think rationally, and therefore such a person can be safely regarded as having nothing relevant to say.

While he may not be wrong about this per se, he does miss a very significant distinction, namely the one between religion and faith. It may be that this distinction is not all that clear or even existent when talking about the various forms of Christianity: Faith may be the most salient principle of modern Christianity. It is, however, quite different when talking about Judaism.

What is Faith?
--------------

I'll define "faith" or "belief" as the blind acceptance of certain principles without reliance on logical proof. Therefore, faith or belief is not something that can be argued with logically. If someone believes that certain entities exist and that they have an influence on his daily life, nothing can be said to rationally convince that person to change his belief. Of course, beliefs can and do change over a person's lifetime, but trying to argue with a believer that his beliefs don't make any sense will never be effective. The very same is true in the converse: It is not possible to logically convince a nonbeliever that he is wrong. Well-known approaches such as "just look around you -- how can you ignore the plainly visible handiwork of God?" fail with the same logical fallacy of trying to prove an axiom. Dawkins, in his book The God Delusion, belabors this point quite well.

I should be careful to point out that I'm not saying anything about the truth or falsehood of the belief, just about the belief itself. As an example, many philosophers throughout history have tried to prove the existance of God logically. None of them have succeeded in this: all so-called proofs contain logical fallacies, inconsistencies or circular arguments. This makes perfect sense from our point of view. Of course, the same can be said for any argument that tries to disprove the existence of God.

The point I'm trying to make here is that belief is not all that a significant issue. What does it matter whether someone believes or disbelieves something? The important issue is whether the person's acts depend on this belief or not. I see no reason to assume that
